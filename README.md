This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and edited according to [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@jorgedjuana/use-mobx-decorators-with-create-react-app-9b37ab699c66) to work with mobx and its glorious decorators.

### Why?
Because I love mobx, and I want a fast and easy starter boilerplate project to avoid all the shenanigans around setting it up manually every time I `cra`ck a cold one.

### Can I use it?
Of course! That's why it's public on GitHub, isn't it? Just clone the thing, do `npm i` and that's all folks.

Also, it's MIT-licensed, so feel free to do as you wish with the contents!

### I want to suggest an improvement, can I?
Sure, you're more than welcome to! Just open an issue and I'll address it in my free time ðŸ˜Ž

#### Have fun and "Happy Hacking"!
